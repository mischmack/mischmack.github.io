## About Me

Hello!
I'm a 2021-2022 cohort [iCAN program](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/ican) student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
I have Bachelors in Finance and in Management Information Systems and I've worked in industry as a software engineer. I'm taking part in the iCAN program and the DREAM program to gain the Computer Science research experience I didn't receive in undergrad. My areas of interest are HCI, Software Engineering, and Security. My research project is based around examining the security practices of smart contract developers.

## About My Advisor

Yang Wang is an associate professor in the School of Information Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He co-directs the Social Computing Systems (SALT) Lab. He was previously an assistant professor in the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University and a research scientist in CyLab at Carnegie Mellon University. His research is centered around usable privacy and security, and social computing. His work has appeared in news media such as The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, BBC, and China Daily. His research has been supported by the National Science Foundation, Department of Health and Human Services, Google, Alcatel-Lucent, and The Privacy Projects. He received his PhD in information and computer science from the University of California, Irvine.

## About My Project

For this project, I will take part in the launch of a large-scale survey study on the security practices of Solidity developers and the analysis of the resulting data. The goal of the study is to help fill the research gap around the security practices of smart contract developers. This study is a follow-up to a previous study [Exploring Security Practices of Smart Contract Developers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11193) done by Tanusree Sharma, Zhixuan Zhou, Andrew Miller, and Yang Wang in the summer of 2021. That study involved an exploratory qualitative study consisting of a semi-structured interview and a code review task with 29 smart contract developers. This new study will be conducted online and offered to various communities of developers. It will consist of a semi-structured interview and a smart contract code review task.
