## Further refining and demoing the survey ##

This week I worked on refining the Qualtrics survey further and demoing the survey from a participant perspective. I took the survey several times to test out the questions and settings. There were a couple issues we had to tweak with response types not being locked (ex. questions that required answers were able to be skipped with no response), whether certain questions should have open or limited answer types, my submissions being marked as spam. After a couple round of reviews we sorted it out. 

It was decided the compensation method would be changed for the new survey from gift cards for each participants to a lottery method to determine who earns a gift card. As a result Professor Yang submitted an amendment to the IRB for approval. Once it is approved we can start sharing the link in developer communities.
