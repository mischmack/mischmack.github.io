## Time conflicts so meeting was cancelled ##

Tanusree and I discussed the possibility of me assisting with processing some data for another project related to smart contracts as we wait for data. She needed to confirm some details with Professor Yang first so we moved the meeting to after her 1:1 meeting for the week. Then I realized that I wouldn't have a stable internet connection on the train I was traveling on and would need to reschedule as well. After all the moves we decided to cancel the meeting for the week. We don't have enough results to discuss yet so we're going to wait until the responses build up.
