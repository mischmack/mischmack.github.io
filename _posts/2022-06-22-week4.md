## Waiting for IRB approval and learning how to find papers ##

We're still waiting to hear back from the IRB on approval for the changes to the survey compensation method. In the mean time, Tanusree mentioned we can discuss the research tools like Mendeley, Google Scholar, and Overleaf that came up in our discussion week 1 while we wait. We're taking this break in time to select and discuss papers related to Human Computer Interaction and Security as those are two of the fields I'm most interested in studying. Tanusree has provided me with several papers to pick from for our discussions. 

I've selected one of the group to read and then we'll discuss them next week. Then we'll repeat this pattern with me using the tools she's taught me about to look for more papers I'm interested in, sharing them with her, and then we'll discuss them the following week. The first paper I've picked is [Dancing Pigs or Externalities? Measuring the Rationality of Security Decisions (Elissa M. Redmiles and Michelle L. Mazurek and John P. Dickerson)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06542.pdf). We'll be discussing it next week.
