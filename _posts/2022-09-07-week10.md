## Final Post ##

The study has been concluded, the data analyzed, and the final paper submitted for conferences. As a part of my research study work for my home university I also created a presentation of the research. That was presented as a video for the research showcase but I've also converted my presentation to PDF slides for the DREAM project. The slides can be accessed [here](files/Jessica_Mack_presentation.pdf). My final report can be access [here](files/finalreport.pdf)

I would like to thank Tanusree and Professor Wang for allowing me to join their study, Professor Gertner for connecting me with Professor Wang, and the DREAM project for giving me support in pursuing this experience. I look forward to applying what I learned during this experience to new research going forward.
