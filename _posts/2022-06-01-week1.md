## Introductions and plans for the project ##

In this first week of the project, we discussed the research project, what I can do, and what I would like to learn. My main focus for learning topics is how to find good research papers and tips for analyzing papers. In my program we had a weekly class dedicated to reading and discussing a paper that was one of the highlights of the program for me. I'd like to improve my knowledge base in Security and Human Computer Interaction research topics as that is where I would like to focus my studies in the future. As Tanusree's secondary study area is Usable Software Security, there's some overlap in our interest areas that she's using to recommend papers for us to go over. We've set up a weekly meeting for the time being with email check ins as well. After we start to get survey responses we'll increases meetings as necessary. For the survey, the current plan is to work on the survey questions and prepare it for release to participants. I'm going to read over the survey planning doc to prepare for our meeting next week.
