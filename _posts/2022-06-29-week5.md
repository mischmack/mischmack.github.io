## Paper Review ##

We had our meeting to discuss [Dancing Pigs or Externalities? Measuring the Rationality of Security Decisions (Elissa M. Redmiles and Michelle L. Mazurek and John P. Dickerson)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06542.pdf). I selected this paper because it's a good example of the type of research question I would like to study. How do humans interact with technology securely? How do we facilitate that either by changing software or better understanding humans' needs?

I didn't really learn anything unexpected in the paper. If anything it mirrored advice and behavior seen in other spheres. Give people more information and they'll make better choices that suit their needs seems obvious but sometimes the point is to back the obvious with results. It was also a good example to study as a well laid out project and report, however so even if the conclusions felt obvious I'm glad I read it.

In other news, the survey has been approved and shared to several communities. Now we wait for results to come in from participants.
