## Proofreading the survey ##

This week I worked on proofreading the Qualtrics survey. This is my first time using Qualtrics so during our weekly meeting Tanusree and I walked through the tool and some of the relevant features I'll need to know once we have to start pulling and analyzing response data. I read over the survey planning doc and provided my feedback over the week to the current planned research questions. I currently work as a full time developer so I've tried to bring that experience to how some of the questions might be interpreted or new questions we could ask to gain further context on the participants experience.
