## Research results check in pt. 3 ##

After filtering the results we had received by the decided criteria to sort out high quality responses, we realized we weren't going to have much data to work with. As a result the survey was reopened and shared with new communities to try to gain more response data. These new communities produced a huge increase in responses. After filtering those new responses we now have 900+ high quality responses to work with.

Those response are now being analyzed in the context of the research questions of the study.
* How do smart contract developers approach or ensure security for smart contracts? Are there any differences between early stage and experienced developers.
* How do smart contract developers conduct code reviews and whether they are able to identify common smart contract security vulnerabilities in the code.

Some takeaways so far, 56% of smart contract developer used more than one tool to learn about smart contract development and User Experience was the highest ranked concern in regards to smart contract development. From here we won't be meeting as often unless needed. The paper is in progress and we'll be handling reviewing it via Overleaf. Further discussion will be handled via email.
